        <!-- About YouTube -->
        <p>
            YouTube is a global video-sharing platform that was created in 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006. It allows users to upload, view, and share videos with a broad audience. YouTube has become a cornerstone of the internet, hosting content from educational tutorials and entertainment to music videos, vlogs, and live streams. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key reasons for YouTube's success is its accessibility. The platform can be used by anyone with an internet connection, and users can upload videos without any cost. Additionally, YouTube's algorithm is designed to promote engaging content, offering personalized recommendations based on user viewing habits. This keeps users returning to the site regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
            YouTube is also a monetization platform for creators. Through the YouTube Partner Program, content creators can earn revenue from ads placed on their videos. This has allowed millions of users to create careers as "YouTubers." The platformâ€™s reach is further extended through its integration with Google services, making it a significant part of online media consumption today.
